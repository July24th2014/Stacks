# Stacks

As a LIFO structure, Stack can track the most recent element being added to the collection. Try to use it to complete the following task.

Given a string that contains only parentheses ('(' and ')') and brackets ('[' and ']') characters, write a program to check if the parentheses and brackets in the string are balanced. Here, balanced means

a left parenthesis/bracket always comes before a corresponding right parenthesis/bracket and thus can be closed by it;
the left parentheses/brackets must be closed by the order they appear in the string (from left to right).
Examples: "()" is balanced. "[([])]" is balanced. "([)" is imbalanced.

Input: a string that only contains '(', ')', '[' and ']';

Output: true if all the parentheses and brackets in the string are balanced; false otherwise.
